# Hi, I'm Lavanya Shree

I'm a final-year B.Tech student specializing in Electronics & Communication Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence at IGDTUW.

### What I'm Building
- **Age & Identity Verification System** — Using DeepFace, OCR, and Flask to verify Aadhaar-based identity with 92%+ accuracy.
- **License Plate Detection for Indian Roads** — YOLOv8-based system to recognize EV/BH vehicle plates for traffic surveillance.
- **PricePulse** — A dynamic ML-powered pricing engine to personalize e-commerce pricing and boost conversion rates.

### Currently Exploring
- Building production-ready ML systems
- Full-stack integrations using **Flask**, **Streamlit**, **React**, and **Firebase**
- Advanced computer vision use-cases (YOLO, DeepFace, OpenCV)

### Actively Looking To
- Contribute to real-world SDE or ML projects
- Intern or collaborate with companies solving large-scale problems
- Improve system design and low-level CS skills
